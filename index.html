</p>

<br>
<p>
I am currently an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs where I work on conversational agents, personalization, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications which make AWS customer experiences better. Prior to my stint at AWS, I was at Amazon Alexa from 2017 to 2021 where I worked on the in-house deep learning toolkit, traditional and neural-based Intent Classification and Slot Recognition models, and architected data pipelines and modeling pipelines for 100k skills. I also was part of the core set of initial contributors who started the Semantic Parsing based utterance recognition at Alexa. I have extensive experience working with (and deploying to scale) traditional Machine Learning models (max-ent models, linear chain CRFs), Deep learning models (LSTM-based models), and also Large Language Models (LLMs ~1B parameters). Before joining Amazon, I obtained my Master's graduate degree from The Ohio State University, Department of Computer Science in 2017. I was advised by <a href="http://aritter.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Alan Ritter</a> and <a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mcdm/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Marie-Catherine de Marneffe</a> (<mark>Still consider them the best advisers, ever! :)</mark>). My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Conversational agents, Semantic Parsing, Large Language Models (LLMs), Text Generation, Personalization, and Social Media data. I was previously the Teaching Associate for <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/cse1222/">Introduction to Computer Programming in C++ for Engineers and Scientists</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have significant programming experience in Python, Java and C(code samples and HackerRank profile can be found in the Navigation bar). I have dabbled with web programming sporadically. I also have extensive experience deploying real-world Machine Learrning systems which used frameworks such as MxNet, Pytorch, HuggingFace, and an in-house Amazon framework which have served millions of customers. During my time at Alexa, I have been a core contributor for the launch of traditional ML models for all Alexa skills, launching DNN-based tiny models for Alexa skills, release of Semantic Parsing based models for utterance recognition, international expansion of Alexa skills, and allowing customers to seamlessly request resource information using natural language on AWS' chat agent.
</p>

<p>
I am fascinated by the amount of information generated on Social Media. Analyzing Twitter data is a big interest of mine since it helps get a better understanding of the kind of things that people are really interested in and want to talk about.

<li>Carried out a project (group of 4) titled <b>"Feature based classifier for differentiating poetry and prose"</b>. I was responsible for the baseline classifier which achieved an F1 score of <b>~85%</b>. <b>(Python, numpy, scipy, CRFSuite)</b></li>
<li>Implemented the EM algorithm on a 1-dimensional dataset using R.</li>
<li>Carried out a project (group of 3) titled <b>"Public Perception to currently showing movies"</b>. I was responsible for the entire design and code. Used TMDb API for fetching movie data and cutting down the number of popular movies based on the popularity index. Then used the Tweepy library to gather tweets with a combination of the words which would be used as a hashtag for the movies. Further, TextBlob API and Naive Bayes Classifier were used to perform Sentiment Analysis. <b>(Python, TextBlob, TMDb API, Tweepy library)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Carried out a project (group of 4) titled <b>"Efficient Information Retrieval using Crawling, Indexing and Ranking"</b>. I was responsible for the crawler module which was used to gather links related to a search query. <b>(Java, JSP)</b></li>
